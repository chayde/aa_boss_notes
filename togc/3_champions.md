{heroism} :    on pull once settled

- CC is really important, DO NOT BREAK THEM
- DO NOT AOE, There is 75% redux on AoE, Single Target only.
- The NPC's same as players + pvp trinket, AOE Fear on pull
- If enemy team bloodlust, mass dispell
- Resilience is not effective here
- Enemies target based on Proximity / health, resests aggro every 9s
