- Raid target icons can be inserted with {rt1} ... {rt8}, or the symbol names: {star}, {circle}, {diamond}, {triangle}, {moon}, {square}, {cross}/{x}, {skull}.
- {tank}, {healer}, and {dps}/{damage} will insert the group role icons.
- {bl}/{bloodlust} will insert the Bloodlust icon, {hero}/{heroism} will insert the Heroism icon.
- {hs}/{healthstone} will insert the Healthstone icon.
- {mage}, {shaman}, {deathknight}, etc will display the icons of the named class.

You can insert any other icon in the game using this syntax: {icon [name/spellID]}. For example, {icon spell_holy_sealofprotection} or {icon 774}. If you use a spellID number, it'll use the icon associated with that spell. Icon names can be looked up by going to a spell or item's page on Wowhead and then clicking on the icon.

Similar to the above, {spell spellID}, {boss encounterID}, and {journal sectionID} will insert "links" to the corresponding spells, bosses, and dungeon journal entries. For example, {spell 155080}. These links will display in AA's display window, but won't be clickable, and thus will generally be more useful when using the "Output" button.

You can use any UI escape sequences, see WoWWiki's page for a full list. You do not need to use double | and \ characters. Also, as an alternative to the typical |cAARRGGBB format for changing color, you can use these special keywords: |cblue, |cgreen, |cred, |cyellow, |corange, |cpink, and |cpurple. You can also use |cCLASSNAME, for example |cshaman or |cdruid, to get that class's color. As an example, "|credHello|r" would display the word "Hello" in red. Note that you cannot nest colors, the |r sequence always reverts the color back to the normal font color. Also note that if you put a player or group name immediately after a UI escape sequence (ie: |rStingray), highlighting of the name won't work properly - you need some space or punctuation inbetween.
